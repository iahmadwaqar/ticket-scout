Do not write test cases files, test codes or summary documents. 
Only complete the task given to you. Do not edit other files unless required.
Don't assume or make up things. If a file, code or any data is missing then ask for it to be provided. Ask clarifying questions before coding.
If need to install or add library just ask for the command to be run by user.
Do you run the project after making changes. Let user do the running testing.
When I ask questions don't write code just answer the questions in technical way no files editing or coding just simple technical answers.
