I have this Step-by-Step Implementation Plan for Launch All Functionality. I am converting the python project Updated Hunter to electonjs app ticket-scout. It has multiple phases. I want to work on this phase now. Follow these instructions.
1. Don't modify already done code. If you need to modify existing code, make sure to first ask me before doing it. With all required changes you want to do and why they necessary.

2. Don't write tests, run tests or run the app. I will do these manually.

3. Don't assume anything. First study the python file mentioned in the task. Then study relevant files from my electornjs app (ticket-scount) the decide what to do. If you don't see a file ask me to provide it to you.

4. Don't make assumptions. If you don't know what to do, ask me. 

5. Plan everything and them implement it. Don't add a lot of validations, errors checks, logs. Also don't create typescript like types and constans. Just work with pure js so it's easy for me to make any changes without defining types etc.

6. I will modify the plan you draw and after it's final we will proceed with it.
